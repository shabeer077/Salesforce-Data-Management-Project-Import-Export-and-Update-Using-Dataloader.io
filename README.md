# Salesforce-Data-Management-Project-Import-Export-and-Update-Using-Dataloader.io
This project showcases my hands-on experience with Salesforce data management using **Dataloader.io**. It was completed as part of the **Trailhead module: "Import and Export with Data Management Tools"**, where I learned how to seamlessly handle CSV imports, exports, updates, and mapping in Salesforce.
